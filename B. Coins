//we need to find  After long economic calculations was decided that the most expensive coin should possess the denomination of exactly n Berland dollars. 
//the denomination of each coin should be divisible by the denomination of any cheaper coin
//so for that if get first i who is denominator of n we change n=i
//so process like that -> n=10 , 10%5==0 , now n=5-> than n=1
//so n=10 ans-> 10->5->1
